# DOM-like tree implementation with reference to parent.

This is just an exercise in rust. I knew that rust memory model makes graphs and circular references hard to implement, so I had to try it. 
A lot of stuff done through copying, so I don't think this implementation is particularly good or performant. 
Right now it is a "proper" version without any unsafe code. 
Maybe later I'll add alternative implementations with more direct memory manipulation to compare performance.
